\runsubsection{Physics Simulator in Java}
\descript{| Private Software Project}
\location{Nov 2019 | Birmingham, UK}
\begin{tightemize}
    \item The simulator currently \textbf{simulates gravity} in $\Delta t$ time steps for all given objects within the space in either high-speed or real-time mode.
    \item It is capable of simulating the Sun-Earth-Moon system over a year with \textbf{astounding precision} as well as short runtime and has a \textbf{variety of features} and extensive documentation.
    \vspace{2mm}

    \item[\faicon{angle-double-right}] I display my ability to \textbf{persue complex private projects} which have real-life application potential. Additionally I prove my ability to \textbf{produce clean and well-documented code}.

\descript{| Private Software Project}
\location{Nov 2019 | Birmingham, UK}
\begin{tightemize}
    \item A small educational project where I implemented a global "joke" command that prints jokes to the terminal. 
    \item[\faicon{angle-double-right}] I tought myself how to write my own shell commands in \textbf{zsh} using \textbf{flag parsing} and how to write \textbf{man pages}.%I learned how to use \textbf{zsh} and write \textbf{man pages}.

\runsubsection{Robot Maze Solver - \fbox{20/20}}
\descript{| University Assignment}
\location{Mar 2019 | Birmingham, UK}
\begin{tightemize}
   \item I lead a Group of 3 on the implementation of a highly complex maze solving program for a \href{https://education.lego.com/en-gb/product/mindstorms-ev3}{\textbf{Lego EV3 robot}} using the \href{http://www.lejos.org/}{\textbf{leJOS EV3}} JVM. 
   Our software solution went far beyond the expected level of the module.
   \item \textbf{Core implementations}: US and IR Scanning + mapping of environment, bluetooth live-updating external GUI, A* path finding, 
   call-back function, fastest route prediction, partial concurrency
   \vspace{2mm}

   \item[\faicon{angle-double-right}] I \textbf{sucessfully lead my team under time pressure} and both \textbf{learned and applied} a variety of new technologies and programming techniques.
