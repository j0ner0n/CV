# Jonas Sch√§fer

My personal industry and research single-page CV.

The CV draft is based on versions of [Lukas Schaefer](https://github.com/LukasSchaefer/CV) and [Deedy-Resume](https://github.com/deedy/Deedy-Resume) and uses [FontAwesome icons](https://fontawesome.com).

Below my CV as an image file, I do recommend viewing the [PDF file](CV.pdf) for interactivity and a better viewing experience. Please note that links and other features may not be functional when viewing on GitHub and may require the PDF file to be downloaded and viewed in a PDF viewer.
